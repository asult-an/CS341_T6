/// This is the IAutoCompleteStrategy interface.  
/// It's an exercise in the AutocompleteStrategy Pattern, wherein we can define multiple algorithms to be used interchangeably.
/// 
/// Since autocomplete will be handled slightly differently depending on the Collection, we'll use an interface
/// to abstract away implementation details.  The biggest benefit of this is so that we can switch to the right 
/// variant of (for example) sorting depending on the expected intensity of the operation. 
///
/// For instance: a short string used to match item names in a collection (e.g. "a") will be much less intensive
/// as we can switch to a search that only looks at the first letter of each item name.  However, a longer string
/// (e.g. "apple") will be more intensive, can requires a better search algorithm, such as a binary search.
